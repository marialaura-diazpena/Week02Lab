            <p>My name is Maria Laura Diaz Pena and I'm a full time student 
                at SAIT. I'm taking the Software Development Diploma and currently
                I'm on my 2nd year.</p>
            <p>I decided to take this program because I wanted to learn how 
                to code and create programs. I like the control and problem-solving 
                skills it takes to make programs, as well the opportunity to put 
                your own personal touch into what you create.</p>
            <p>I love learning new things and with software development I know 
                I'll never run out of things to learn to improve my skills.</p>
